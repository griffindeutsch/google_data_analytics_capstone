## Ask
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company looking to tailor their marketing strategy to entice more 'casual' riders (i.e. riders that purchase single-ride or one-day passes) into annual members. The business task is to figure out how casual riders and annual members differ in their behavior so as to identify how Cyclistic could better target how to make membership more appealing to casual riders.

## Prepare
Cyclistic data used for this project is located at [https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). I used each month's data for 2023. Due to the size of the datasets, I'll be using R to process the data. I started by combining the individual CSV files into a single dataframe. From there, I noted some initial limitations of the data:

- The size of the combined datasets exceeded limitations of Excel and Google Sheets, so could not be (easily) imported into a single spreadsheet.
- Due to user data-privacy limitations, riders' personally identifiable information is not available. So, for example, riders cannot be connected to ride IDs, indicating whether one rider may be a frequent 'casual' rider but not a member.
- The data contained redundant information for the purposes of this analysis (e.g. station IDs).
