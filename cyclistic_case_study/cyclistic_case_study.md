## Ask
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company looking to tailor their marketing strategy to entice more 'casual' riders (i.e. riders that purchase single-ride or one-day passes) into annual members. The business task is to figure out how casual riders and annual members differ in their behavior so as to identify how Cyclistic could better target how to make membership more appealing to casual riders.

## Prepare
Cyclistic data used for this project is located at [https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). I used each month's data for 2023. Due to the size of the datasets, I'll be using R to process the data. I started by combining the individual CSV files into a single dataframe. From there, I noted some initial limitations of the data:

- The size of the combined datasets exceeded limitations of Excel and Google Sheets, so could not be (easily) imported into a single spreadsheet.
- Due to user data-privacy limitations, riders' personally identifiable information is not available. So, for example, riders cannot be connected to ride IDs, indicating whether one rider may be a frequent 'casual' rider but not a member.
- The data contained redundant information for the purposes of this analysis (e.g. station IDs).

## Process

### Transformation
I started with adding a column titled 'ride_length' that is the result of subtracting the values of column 'started_at' from 'ended_at'. I then rounded the resulting values to the nearest whole minute.

```
#Create ride_length column
data_2023 <- data_2023 |>
  mutate(ride_length = difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins"))

#Round ride_length column to nearest whole minute
data_2023$ride_length <- round(data_2023$ride_length, 0)
```
I then added columns 'start_date', 'end_date', 'start_time', 'end_time', 'day_of_week', and 'month', using values from columns 'started_at' and 'ended_at', respectively.

```
#Create start_date column
data_2023$start_date <- as.Date(data_2023$started_at)

#Create end_date column
data_2023$end_date <- as.Date(data_2023$ended_at)

#Create start_time column
data_2023$start_time <- format(as.POSIXct(data_2023$started_at), format = "%H:%M:%S")

#Create end_time column
data_2023$end_time <- format(as.POSIXct(data_2023$ended_at), format = "%H:%M:%S")

#Create day_of_week column using lubridate package
data_2023$day_of_week <- wday(data_2023$started_at, label = TRUE)

#Create month column
data_2023$month <- month(data_2023$started_at, label = TRUE)
```

Next, I changed the names of column 'member_casual' to 'rider_type', and 'rideable_type' to 'bike_type'.

```
data_2023 <- data_2023 |>
  rename(bike_type = rideable_type)

data_2023 <- data_2023 |>
  rename(rider_type = member_casual)
```

Lastly, I removed columns irrelevant for analysis in this case study. For example, the values in column 'ride_id' cannot be connected to specific customers due to data-privacy issues.

```
data_2023 <- select(data_2023, -c(ride_id, start_station_id, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))
```


### Cleaning
I then began some basic cleaning of the data: removing NA values, duplicate rows, and rows that included a value less than zero in the 'ride_length' column (as having a negative trip duration is impossible).

```
#Remove any rows with NA values
data_2023 <- na.omit(data_2023)

#Remove any duplicate rows
data_2023 <- unique(data_2023)

#Remove any rows where the value in 'ride_length' is less than 0
data_2023 <- data_2023[data_2023$ride_length >= 0, ]
```

Next, I removed some rows meeting certain criteria which represented potentially unreliable data. This was assigned to a new dataframe 'data_2023_filtered'. The following rows were filtered using the subset function.
1. Rows where 'bike_type' was 'docked_bike'.
2. Rows where 'ride_length' was less than 1 minute.
3. Rows where 'ride_length' exceeded 600 minutes (10 hours). (I will further filter the data in the analysis process to make visualization easier)

```
#Filter rows where 'bike_type' equals 'docked_bike'
data_2023_filtered <- subset(data_2023, bike_type != 'docked_bike')

#Filter rows where 'ride_length' is less than 1 minute or greater than 600 minutes.
data_2023_filtered <- subset(data_2023, ride_length > 0 & ride_length <= 600)
```

## Analyze

First, I calculated the mean and standard deviation of the 'ride_length' column. This will allow me to identify outliers that could skew visualizations.

```
#Calculate the mean of 'ride_length'
ride_length_mean <- mean(data_2023_filtered$ride_length)

#Calculate the standard deviation of 'ride_length'
ride_length_sd <- sd(data_2023_filtered$ride_length)
```
The result of ride_length_mean is 14.39897 mins and the result of ride_length_sd is 19.20853. The two sigma threshold would therefore be 52.81603, representative of 95% of the (filtered) dataset. Since the column 'ride_length' deals with duration, there is no need to calculate the lower threshold, as it would be a negative duration.

From this result, I created a new dataframe 'data_2023_filtered_sd' which excludes rows that contain a value in 'ride_length' greater than 53 mins. This dataframe will be used to create visualizations involving ride length.

```
data_2023_filtered_sd <- subset(data_2023_filtered, ride_length <= 53)
```

Then, I did some basic calculations on the data to highlight differences between casual riders and members.

```
#Calculate mean ride length for casual riders
casual_rider_mean_length <- data_2023_filtered |>
  filter(rider_type == "casual") |>
  summarise(casual_rider_mean_length = mean(ride_length))
#Print the result
print(casual_rider_mean_length)

#Calculate mean ride length for members
member_rider_mean_length <- data_2023_filtered |>
  filter(rider_type == "member") |>
  summarise(member_rider_mean_length = mean(ride_length))
#Print the result
print(member_rider_mean_length)

#Calculate the mode for the column 'day_of_week' using DescTools mode() function
day_of_week_mode <- Mode(data_2023_filtered$day_of_week)
#Print the result
print(day_of_week_mode)
```
I then prepared the data for visualization while analyzing the data. First, I created two new dataframes comparing rider type behaviors: one that groups number of riders per month by rider type and one that groups numbers of riders per day by rider type.

```
#Create new dataframe that groups numbers of riders per month by rider type
ride_count_by_month <- data_2023_filtered |>
  group_by(month, rider_type) |>
  summarise(ride_count = n())

#Create new dataframe that groups numbers of riders per day by rider type
ride_count_by_day <- data_2023_filtered |>
  group_by(day_of_week, rider_type) |>
  summarise(ride_count = n())
```

## [Share](#share----create-data-visualizations)

I created the following visualizations to determine relationships between casual riders and members.

### Histogram of Ride Length by Rider Type
```
ggplot(data_2023_filtered_sd, aes(x = ride_length, fill = rider_type)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", binwidth = 1) +
    labs(title = "Ride Length by Rider Type",
    x = "Ride Length (minutes)",
    y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number())
```
We can see from this histogram that while both members and casual riders ride around the same duration on average, many more short trips are by members rather than casual riders.

### Horizontal Bar Graphs of Average Ride Lengths by Rider Type

I then wanted to compare trip duration between members and casual riders across months and days. I created two separate horizontal bar graphs to do this.

```
#Create horizontal bar graph showing Average Ride Length by Rider Type by Month
data_2023_filtered_sd |>
  group_by(month, rider_type) |>
  summarise(average_ride_length = mean(ride_length)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = average_ride_length, fill = rider_type, label = round(average_ride_length, 1))) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    geom_text(aes(y = round(average_ride_length, 1))) +
    coord_flip() +
      labs(title = "Average Ride Length by Rider Type (by Month)",
          x = "Month",
          y = "Average Ride Length (mins)") +
    theme_minimal()

#Create horizontal bar graph showing Average Ride Length by Rider Type by Day of Week
data_2023_filtered_sd |>
  group_by(day_of_week, rider_type) |>
  summarise(average_ride_length = mean(ride_length)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_ride_length, fill = rider_type, label = round(average_ride_length, 1))) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    geom_text(aes(y = round(average_ride_length, 1))) +
    coord_flip() +
      labs(title = "Average Ride Length by Rider Type (by Day)",
          x = "Day of Week",
          y = "Average Ride Length (mins)") +
    theme_minimal()
```

Average ride length was 2.33 minutes longer on average per month for casual riders.
